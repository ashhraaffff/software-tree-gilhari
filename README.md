Gilhari Simplifying Exchanging of JSON data with an RDBMS on Microsoft Azure

# Description
This repository showcases how the Gilhari microservice framework streamlines the process of exchanging JSON data with an RDBMS on Azure. This capability is demonstrated through two subprojects: BookstoreSchema and EmployeeSchema, which illustrate the functionality of handling JSON data.

Developed by Software Tree, the Gilhari microservice framework is designed to simplify the integration of application-specific object and relational models. Available as a Docker image, Gilhari is highly configurable to meet the specific needs of various applications. It offers a REST interface that provides APIs for standard CRUD operations—Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete—on JSON objects. This REST interface supports multiple HTTP methods, including POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, making it easy to manage data without writing additional code for API handling or database access.

The framework's flexibility and ease of use significantly reduce the complexity involved in developing and maintaining data exchange processes. Users can focus on their application logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

For those interested in learning more about the capabilities and applications of the Gilhari microservice framework, additional information is available on Software Tree’s website at https://www.softwaretree.com. This resource provides comprehensive details on how Gilhari can be leveraged to enhance data handling efficiency and streamline application development.
